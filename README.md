Maps

A map is a symbolic depiction highlighting relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, and themes. The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world. Road maps are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and nautical charts, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on a general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area. The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.


Similar to other types of sources, maps should not be self published sources, and the reliability of the publisher should be considered before use. Maps directly derived from government surveys, GIS data and aerial or satellite images are generally reliable. Maps made by commercial interests for promotion of business may not be reliable. Online maps should be treated the same as web sources, listing both the date the cartography was completed (if known) and the date the information was accessed, as online content can frequently change.

This service provides a Worldmap with a scales and zoomable capabilities for frelance exploring. It provides an opertunity for prople for geting to know the world better.From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the cartographer has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering survey level, has been subsumed by Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such superimposition of data led Dr. John Snow to identify the location of an outbreak of cholera. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.




Navigation Mapping Service

Enter two or more distinct locations into the Google Maps website to get driving, walking and cycling directions for the most practical routes. Depending on the location you are interested in, public transport directions also may be available. If several possible routes exist, you will see a summary of each with a rough estimate of the time that each route would take.Depending on the location you are interested in, Google Maps can provide additional information you might find useful, such as current traffic load, road work and road closures, photos of areas and landmarks, nearby webcams, and weather forecasts. If you search for the location of a business, Google Maps will provide you with a general rating and reviews of that business and a link to the company's website, if one exists.

Software generated mind maps or hand-drawn? Do you use one, or the other, or both? Do you have a preference, or do they both serve you equally well in functionality and application depending on the situation? I bet most, if not all mindmapping software users also create hand-drawn mind maps. Both methods clearly have huge benefits and advantages and occasions when each proves a better option. As a hand-drawn mindmapper, I am sharing here my thoughts on the advantages of using the hand-drawn mind map method. Hand-drawn mindmapping will always exist in the same way books will always exist technology wont, in my opinion, replace traditional methods; it will work alongside it. E-Books are an option not a replacement. Mindmapping software is an option not a replacement. Come back in 100 years time and perhaps things may look very different, yet I doubt it! The handson and personal feeling and satisfaction of reading a physical book or creating art or writing by hand on paper provides a body and mind connection that isnt always there when using computers and technology. It could be likened to the difference between playing tennis on a computer or physically. The hands-on method of hand-drawn mindmapping has a multitude of advantages not advantages over software, advantages of the handdrawn method itself. Rather than drawing comparisons between handdrawn mindmapping and mindmapping software, I am focusing here specifically on what makes handdrawn mindmapping so versatile, in and of itself.
